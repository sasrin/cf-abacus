CF-Abacus
===

The Abacus Cloud service usage metering and aggregation project.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sasrin/cf-abacus.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sasrin/cf-abacus) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sasrin/cf-abacus/badge.svg?branch=dev&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/sasrin/cf-abacus?branch=dev)

Overview
---

Abacus provides usage metering and aggregation for [Cloud Foundry (CF)](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) services. It is implemented as a set of REST micro-services that collect usage data, apply metering formulas, and aggregate usage at several levels within a Cloud Foundry organization.

Abacus provides a REST API allowing Cloud service providers to submit usage data, and a REST API allowing usage dashboards, and billing systems to retrieve usage reports.

Abacus is implemented in Node.js and the different micro-services can run as CF apps.

The Abacus REST API is described in [doc/api.md](doc/api.md).

Installing
---

Abacus can be installed using Npm >= 2.10.1.

```sh
cd cf-abacus

# This installs all the Node.js module dependencies
npm install
```

Testing
---

Abacus runs on Node.js >= 0.12.1, io.js >= 2.3.0, and can also run on Node 0.10.36-0.10.39 using Babel.

```sh
cd cf-abacus

# This runs eslint on all the modules
npm run lint

# This runs all the tests
npm test
```

Deploying to Cloud Foundry
---

Abacus runs as a set of applications deployed to Cloud Foundry. Each application is configured to run in multiple instances for availability and performance. Service usage data is stored in CouchDB databases.

This diagram shows the main Abacus apps and their role in the processing of usage data.

The following steps assume a local Cloud Foundry deployment created using [Bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) and running on the default local IP 10.244.0.34 assigned to that deployment. Please adjust to your particular Cloud Foundry deployment environment.

```sh
cd cf-abacus

# This installs all the Node.js module dependencies
npm install

# Point the CF CLI to your local Cloud Foundry deployment
cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.10.244.0.34.xip.io
cf login -o <your organization> -s <your space>

# This simply runs cf push on all the Abacus apps to deploy them to Cloud Foundry
npm run cfpush

# Check the state of the Abacus apps
cf apps

# You should see something like this
Getting apps in org <your organization> / space <your space>...
OK

Running the demo
---

The Abacus demo runs a simple test program that simulates the submission of usage by a Cloud service provider, then gets a daily report for the usage aggregated within a Cloud Foundry organization.

The demo data is stored in a small in-memory [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com) test database so the demo is self-contained and you don't need to set up a real CouchDB database just to run it.

Once the Abacus apps are running on your Cloud Foundry deployment, do this:

```sh
cd cf-abacus

# Run the demo script
npm run demo 10.244.0.34.xip.io

# You should see usage being submitted and a usage report for the demo organization

```

Running Abacus on localhost
---

The Abacus apps can also run on your local host in a shell environment outside of Cloud Foundry, like this:

```sh
cd cf-abacus

# Start the Abacus apps
npm start

# Wait a bit until all the apps have started

# Run the demo script
npm run demo

# Stop everything
npm stop
```

Layout
---

The Abacus source tree is organized as follows:

```sh

bin/ - Start, stop, demo and cf push scripts 

demo/ - Demo apps

    client - demo program that posts usage and gets a report

doc/ - Abacus API documentation

lib/ - Abacus modules

    metering/ - Metering services

        collector - receives and collects service usage data
        meter     - applies metering formulas to usage data

    aggregation/ - Aggregation services

        accumulator - accumulates usage over time
        aggregator  - aggregates usage within an organization
        reporting   - returns usage reports

    config/ - Usage formula configuration
    
    rating/ - Rating services
    
        rate - applies pricing formulas to usage

    utils/ - Utility modules used by the above

    stubs/ - Test stubs for provisioning and account services

test - End to end tests

    perf/ - Performance tests

etc/ - Misc build scripts
